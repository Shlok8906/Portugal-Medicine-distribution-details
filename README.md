💊 Portugal Medicine Sales Analysis
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about medicines distributed across Portugal, including:

Units sold

Price per unit

Total revenue

Delivery location

The goal is to extract insights on medicine performance and regional distribution using a mix of Google Colab (Python) and Excel.

🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key fields:

Medicine Name

Units Sold

Sales Price

Total Sales

Delivery Location (city/region)

🛠️ What Has Been Done
✅ 1. Data Cleaning & Validation (in Google Colab)
Loaded and inspected dataset using Pandas

Checked for:

Missing values

Nulls or incorrect data types

Data consistency issues

📈 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn
Created various visualizations using Seaborn to understand:

Distribution of medicine sales

Regional comparison of sales

Outlier detection

Correlation between units and total revenue

These visualizations are included in the Colab notebook.

📊 3. Detailed Excel-Based Reporting
Designed multiple Excel sheets to:

Summarize medicine-wise unit sales

Calculate individual and total sales

Track region-wise distribution

Present data using pivot tables and charts
